# Introduction
This project aims to predict loan fraud by analyzing a dataset containing customer and loan-related information. 
The dataset includes various features like credit scores, annual income, and credit history, which are used to train and evaluate machine learning models.

# Objective
Identify fraudulent loan applications by:

Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
Addressing class imbalance using techniques from imbalanced-learn.
Building and evaluating machine learning models.


# Example Results
Precision: Measure of positive predictive value.
Recall: Measure of the ability to identify fraud cases.
F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.
